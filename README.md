SimpleSemVer is a simple semantic versioning module written in PowerShell. Most semantic versioning systems tightly integrate with git or are language specific 
and push out users who need a simple solution for versioning, but can't find one for their language/setup/CI/etc. SimpleSemVer aims to be that solution by being as
simple and easy to use as possible.
